# NIC2023 Santas workshop tour
This is Scheduling Optimization Problem project of our group on Santa's workshop tour. In our project we used Simulated Annealing method along with Genetic Algorithm for solving this problem. 

Our main objective is to find an optimal solution to the Santa Workshop 2019 Tour problem. So, there are 5000 families that Santa needs to visit. Santa has only 100 days to visit all of them. Each family has from 2 to 8 family members and a list of 10 preferred days (from most to least preferred). However, there's also several constraints:
- Santa has to visit from 125 to 300 people each day;
- For each family which preferred days were not met, there is a cost of consolation gift
- There is accounting cost that depends on the number of people attending each day.

Simulated Annealing is a family of algorithms. Its main advantage is that allow selecting not only the best genes out of the whole population, but they also have a small chance of picking a worse gene. This approach introduces exploration and allows escaping the local optima.
